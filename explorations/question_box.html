                We hope that the question box will provide more open communication between students and WCS/staff at UIUC, 
                as well as give students a more personalized experience/opportunity to talk with experts and staff of WCS. By 
                storing and giving students access to the answers to previous questions, we also hope that the question box will 
                become a good place to find specific resources that students are looking for.

                Type in a question that you are interested in knowing more about. This is a safe space and we are excited to help

            <p><strong>
                Hello. I'm an incoming freshman at UIUC, LAS, Mathematics Major. It was my second choice major. My first choice major was 
                CS, Grainger College of Engineering. My interest lies in CS and Maths both and as I've browsed more, I got to know about 
                Math and CS major. Now I'm highly inclined towards Math and CS or just CS. I'm thinking of transferring into one of them 
                the next year. However, I'm concerned whether such transfers are common or will it be too difficult to do so. I'm intending 
                to take CS classes during my first year there and definitely would love to get involved in CS related activities at the 
                campus. Could you provide an insight into the such transfers in majors. Thank you.
            </strong></p>
            <p>
                It is tough to transfer to any CS program at Illinois and taking CS courses during your first year is a great start to 
                meeting requirements for transfer consideration. Because CS has programs in partnership with many other departments, 
                including Math, your summer registration advisor in the Math department will be able to advise you on courses to take 
                in preparation for an application to a CS program.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you would like to prepare to transfer to Math & CS in the College of LAS, you will need to complete certain courses 
                with high grades, and meet an overall GPA, then you will submit a portfolio describing your interests and non-academic 
                connections to the program.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you would like to prepare to apply to Computer Science in the Grainger College of Engineering there is a multi-step 
                path, including an application to Pre-Engineering in your 2nd semester (freshman year). More information about 
                Pre-Engineering is shared on the 
                <a href="https://provost.illinois.edu/education/advising-resources/intercollegiate-transfer-process/pre-engineering-prep/" 
                target="_blank">Provost's Website</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                General information about transferring on campus to Computer Science programs is available on the 
                <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/admissions/undergraduate/transfer-students" target="_blank">CS Department Website</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is great to have a back-up plan and a Computer Science minor can be a part of that plan. Information about the minor is 
                detailed on the <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/degree-program-options/minor-computer-science" 
                target="_blank">CS Department Website</a>. The Computer Science minor is available to all undergraduate students, except 
                those majoring in Computer Science (including CS+X) or Computer Engineering majors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Feel free to continue to send these types of questions on to CS advising.

                What are some different grad school options for CS students?
            </strong></p>
            <p>
                There are many different grad school options for CS students. In the Illinois Computer Science Department, there are a 
                variety of graduate programs in the CS department (more information is available on the 
                <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate" target="_blank">CS department website</a>). The BS-MCS and BS-MS 
                programs are 5-year programs. MCS alone is a 1.5-2 year professional degree that involves further coursework. An MS in 
                CS is a ~2 year long program involving coursework & a thesis. MCS is more so intended for students going into industry. 
                Students that want to get a PhD or write a thesis may prefer the 2 year MS program as the 5 year BS-MS doesn't allow a 
                lot of time to write a thesis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Otherwise, all around the country there are other MS, professional Masters, and PhD programs. You can also enter a 
                PhD program right out of your BS. Or you could go to grad school for something completely different from CS!
            </p>

                What resources does WCS have that I can use to improve my technical skills?
            </strong></p>
            <p>
                We have lots of opportunities! First, Explorations hosts weekly workshops on a variety of technical topics, ranging from 
                git (version control) to databases. Past workshop slides and activities can be found on 
                <a href="http://wcs.illinois.edu/explorations/index.html" target="_blank">our website</a>. On our website are also some 
                short, asynchronous activities like our Git MBTI board and our Babbling Binary site. We also will be posting longer-term 
                resources on more difficult topics like React on our website soon! Additionally, Explorations holds an all-female and 
                non-binary hackathon called Code Ada every fall, after which we also host a set of project teams for the spring semester. 
                Be on the lookout for these opportunities in the future! Finally, if you need any personalized help, you can always use 
                this question box or the #ask-anything channel in the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/wcsslackinvite"
