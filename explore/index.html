                        WCS Explore CS Series is an informative video series about the research our professors have done, using computer science applications, to impact different fields of work. We hope this series will allow young teenagers, and possibly even <b>you</b> reading this, to learn more about the opportunities available through studying computer science!
                        We are bringing professors from all fields of expertise to talk about how they have used computer science to complete their research and how it affects the field they work in, as well as communities around the world!
                        Stay tuned to our YouTube channel and check out our introductory article to learn more!

                                Gang Wang is a well-praised Professor here at our university, as indicated by his receival of 
                                the NSF CAREER Award (2018), Google Faculty Research Award (2017), IMWUT Distinguished Paper 
                                Award (2019), and much more! Professor Gang focuses his specialization on fields such as: Security 
                                and Privacy, Internet Measurement, Mobile Networks, and HCI. His presentation with us here is within 
                                the Security and Privacy realm, specifically focused on Spoofing and Spear-Phishing. Spear-phishing 
                                is the exploitation of human factors to attack and breach target networks. Spoofing is a critical 
                                step in phishing, where the attacker impersonates a trusted entity to gain the victim’s trust. In 
                                this talk, Professor Gang will describe a measurement study to understand how flawed system designs 
                                can severely weaken user-level defenses in spear-phishing attacks. Through the illustration of data 
                                analytics and active measurements, he will show us how we can better understand the reasons behind 
                                successful spoofing attempts and how users react to spoofed messages. Professor Gang will also touch 
                                upon his other on-going research in his group that focuses on combining machine learning and human 
                                efforts to jointly improve security. Make sure to tune into this session to learn more about Security 
                                and Privacy applications, and why they are important to understand!

                                Mattox Beckman is a Computer Science Professor at UIUC who has taught many prominent upper 
                                level CS classes at our university. Professor Beckman is also an alumnus at our university, 
                                having studied here for around 14 years (from undergrad to PhD)! He is well versed in the study 
                                of programming languages, as well as Computer Science education as a whole. The main focus for 
                                Professor Beckman’s presentation here is the structure of programming languages and their 
                                language families, including how they relate to the many languages that we are familiar with 
                                around the world! He will also be discussing Computer Science education, and why it is important 
                                to understand the impact that education like this has on not only the CS field, but the world 
                                as well. Make sure to tune in to this session to learn more about how you can get started in 
                                learning about Computer Science yourself!

                                Within this field, Professor Jiang focuses mainly on Reinforcement 
                                Learning (RL), and algorithmic understandings of this phenomenon. 
                                His presentation with us today explains RL using Video Games as 
                                examples, as well as the successes and possible future successes of 
                                RL as a whole. Make sure to tune into Professor Jiang’s presentation to
