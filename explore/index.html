                        WCS Explore CS Series is an informative video series about the research our professors have done, using computer science applications, to impact different fields of work. We hope this series will allow young teenagers, and possibly even <b>you</b> reading this, to learn more about the opportunities available through studying computer science!
                        We are bringing professors from all fields of expertise to talk about how they have used computer science to complete their research and how it affects the field they work in, as well as communities around the world!
                        Stay tuned to our YouTube channel and check out our introductory article to learn more!

                    <p>
                        Through this series we hope aspiring, uncertain, and interested students alike will be able to 
                        gain better insight into how computer science can help you actualize your personal goals and 
                        interests. Computer science work is not just what it looks like in the media — it can be fun, 
                        interactive, and fulfilling. Not all computer scientists sit around a computer screen all day, 
                        and not all of us are code monkeys! We hope to show through this series that computer science 
                        is more than what it seems, and can be used in a vast number of fields in various ways!!

                                of Illinois. With a Ph. D. in Electrical Engineering from the University 
                                of Texas Austin and postdoctoral work at Stanford University in 
                                neuroimaging data techniques, his research interests range from brain 
                                data analysis to interpreting data from models and the fairness of these 
                                models. He is especially interested in research using machine learning for 
                                neuroscience and biomedical imaging.  We are excited to have him speak 
                                about AI for turning x-ray images into 3D CT images, how AI can be applied 
                                in the medical field to help develop treatment plans, as well as some of 
                                the privacy and trustworthiness issues that can arise from using these 
                                methods.

                                Gang Wang is a well-praised Professor here at our university, as indicated by his receival of 
                                the NSF CAREER Award (2018), Google Faculty Research Award (2017), IMWUT Distinguished Paper 
                                Award (2019), and much more! Professor Gang focuses his specialization on fields such as: Security 
                                and Privacy, Internet Measurement, Mobile Networks, and HCI. His presentation with us here is within 
                                the Security and Privacy realm, specifically focused on Spoofing and Spear-Phishing. Spear-phishing 
                                is the exploitation of human factors to attack and breach target networks. Spoofing is a critical 
                                step in phishing, where the attacker impersonates a trusted entity to gain the victim’s trust. In 
                                this talk, Professor Gang will describe a measurement study to understand how flawed system designs 
                                can severely weaken user-level defenses in spear-phishing attacks. Through the illustration of data 
                                analytics and active measurements, he will show us how we can better understand the reasons behind 
                                successful spoofing attempts and how users react to spoofed messages. Professor Gang will also touch 
                                upon his other on-going research in his group that focuses on combining machine learning and human 
                                efforts to jointly improve security. Make sure to tune into this session to learn more about Security 
                                and Privacy applications, and why they are important to understand!

                                Professor Beckman’s presentation here is the structure of programming languages and their 
                                language families, including how they relate to the many languages that we are familiar with 
                                around the world! He will also be discussing Computer Science education, and why it is important 
                                to understand the impact that education like this has on not only the CS field, but the world

                                Lawrence Angrave is a well-known professor in the UIUC Computer Science department. 
                                Having taught many major core CS classes offered at our university, received many awards, 
                                and served on many committees, including the Technology Accessibility Review Committee, 
                                Professor Angrave focuses much of his efforts on accessibility within Computer Science Education. 
                                Within his presentation with us today, Professor Angrave discusses ClassTranscribe and the 
                                benefits of having a Closed Captioning service in educational videos. He also discusses 
                                disabilities within education, and how this field can work towards being more inclusive!
