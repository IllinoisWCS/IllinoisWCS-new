                        WCS Explore CS Series is an informative video series about the research our professors have done, using computer science applications, to impact different fields of work. We hope this series will allow young teenagers, and possibly even <b>you</b> reading this, to learn more about the opportunities available through studying computer science!
                        We are bringing professors from all fields of expertise to talk about how they have used computer science to complete their research and how it affects the field they work in, as well as communities around the world!
                        Stay tuned to our YouTube channel and check out our introductory article to learn more!
